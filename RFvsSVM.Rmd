## Introduction

The dataset given is a collection of features describing an image. The images are classified into 6 types(cotton_crop, damp_grey_soil, grey_soil, red_soil, soil_with_vegetation_stubble, very_damp_grey_soil)

The aim is to predict the classification of a satellite image, given the multi-spectral values.

Also, we need to show which classification method works better (i.e multinomial logistic regression or random forests)

the dataset is loaded and the classes are converted into factors to represent the categorical type.

```{r}
library(mlbench)
library(randomForest)
library(nnet)

data("Satellite")
# this will re-order alphabetically class labels and remove spacing
Satellite$classes <- gsub(" ", "_", Satellite$classes)
Satellite$classes <- factor( as.character(Satellite$classes) )
# to have the same initial split
set.seed(777222)
D <- nrow(Satellite)

```

Now, a set of 100 iterations is performed. In each iteration, 5 iterations of randomforest classification and logistic regression are performed on a sampled dataset. The misclassification error for the cross validation set of both the models is noted.


```{r,fig.width=10}

B = 100

K = 5

overall = vector("list",length = B)



for(i in 1:B){

  keep = sample(1:D,5500)
  cross_rows = setdiff(1:D, keep)

  train = Satellite[keep,]
  cross = Satellite[cross_rows,]

  error = matrix(NA,nrow = K,ncol = 2)
    
for(k in 1:K){
  
 
  # random forest
  rf = randomForest(classes~.,data = train,ntree = 10)
  
  class = predict(rf,cross,type = "class")
  tab = table(class,cross$classes)
  
  
  # test error of random forest
  error[k,1] =  1 - (sum( diag(tab) ) / sum(tab))
  
  
  
  # logistic regression
  model = multinom(classes~.,data = train,maxit=300,trace = FALSE)
  
  class = predict(model,cross,type = "class")
  tab = table(class,cross$classes)
  
  
  # test error of logistic regression
  error[k,2] =  1 - (sum( diag(tab) ) / sum(tab))
  
}
  
  overall[[i]] = error
  
}




```


Here, 1 - average of 5 iterations in each iteration is taken. This gives the average classification rate for 100 iterations. Then the overall average is taken.

```{r}

avg <-1 - t(sapply(overall, colMeans) ) # 50 average values for both the models (accuracy)
# column 1 represents random forest
# column 2 represents multinomial logistic regression


meanAcc <-colMeans(avg) 
meanAcc
```

We can see that the classification rate for the random forest is better compared to the multinomial logistic regression.

We will be proceeding with the variance of the classification rate to choose which is the best model for assessing the generalized error.



```{r}

sdAcc <- apply(avg, 2, sd)/sqrt(B) # estimated mean accuracy standard deviation
sdAcc


```


we can see that both the models have low variance and almost similar, in that case, we can choose the random forest classification.

we can visualize the accuracy rate on each iteration and the deviation occurred on each iteration for both the models

```{r}
matplot(avg, type = "l", lty = c(2,3), col = c("darkorange2", "deepskyblue3"),
xlab = "Replications", ylab = "ACCURACY")

##add confidence intervals

bounds1 <- rep( c(meanAcc[1] - 2*sdAcc[1], meanAcc[1] + 2*sdAcc[1]), each = B )
bounds2 <- rep( c(meanAcc[2] - 2*sdAcc[2], meanAcc[2] + 2*sdAcc[2]), each = B )
polygon(c(1:B, B:1), bounds1, col = adjustcolor("darkorange2", 0.2), border = FALSE)
polygon(c(1:B, B:1), bounds2, col = adjustcolor("deepskyblue3", 0.2), border = FALSE)
##add estimated mean line

abline(h = meanAcc, col = c("darkorange2", "deepskyblue3"))
##add legend

legend("bottomleft", fill = c("darkorange2", "deepskyblue3"),
legend = c("random forest", "logistic"), bty = "n")
```




## Assessing the predictive performance

As the accuracy rate and the standard deviation was low for the randomforest. Hence we proceed to calculate the predictive performance on random forest

```{r}

keep <- sample(1:D, 5500)
test <- setdiff(1:D, keep)
dat <- Satellite[keep,]
dat_test <- Satellite[test,]


final_model = randomForest(classes~.,data=dat,ntree = 10)

class = predict(final_model,dat_test,type = "class")
tab = table(class,dat_test$classes)

accuracy = (sum( diag(tab) ) / sum(tab))

accuracy

1 - accuracy

```

The accuracy rate for the randomforest for the given dataset is 0.90

The generalized error for the randomforest for the given set of data is 0.09 approximately.

We can say that the classification rate is good
